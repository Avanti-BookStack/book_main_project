  <h2><p>PROBLEM: Connecting Readers for Book Exchange</p></h2>

<p>The reading community faces a constant and frustrating challenge: despite the enthusiasm for sharing books, many members see their precious collections gathering dust on the shelves. Without a dedicated platform, finding other readers interested in exchanging books becomes an almost impossible task. This problem creates a cycle of literary isolation, where books that could bring joy and knowledge to others remain untouched.

Currently, the reading community lacks an efficient means to facilitate communication and logistics for book exchanges. Members resort to informal and ineffective methods, such as sporadic messages in social media groups, which often result in missed or poorly coordinated exchanges. The absence of an organized system means there is no reliable way to list available books, search for desired titles, or ensure that participants fulfill agreed-upon exchanges.

This technological gap not only hinders the exchange process but also deprives members of the opportunity to discover new stories and establish meaningful connections with other passionate readers. The lack of transaction history and a reputation system means that trust among members is low, discouraging active and continuous participation.

To address these issues, it is essential to develop a digital platform that serves as a virtual meeting point for the reading community members. This platform should allow readers to list their books for exchange, search for desired titles, organize the logistics of exchanges, and share their literary experiences. Additionally, features such as reviews and reputation systems can help build a trustworthy and engaged community.

A well-designed digital solution would not only facilitate the sharing of literary resources but also foster a culture of exchange and social interaction. By implementing this platform, the reading community could transform the experience of its members, promoting an environment where the love of reading and community spirit thrive.</p>

<h1>Project Dynamics</h1>

<ul>
   <p>To solve the problem "Connecting Readers for Book Exchange," teams will be divided and tasked with implementing a complete web solution. The project will be divided into three main deliveries, each focused on different aspects of full-stack development. </p>
</ul>

<ul>
  <h2><p>Delivery 1: Solution Proposal and Database Modeling</p></h2>
  <p>In the first phase, teams must develop a detailed solution proposal, including database modeling:
  Define requirements;
  Create an entity-relationship diagram;
  Model the database using PostgreSQL, specifying the necessary tables, fields, and relationships to support the proposed functionalities</p>
  
  <h2><p>Delivery 2: API Development</p></h2>
  <p>In the second phase, teams will focus on developing the API, which will serve as the backend layer of the application:
  Implement the API using Node.js and Express;
  Configure Prisma ORM to interact with the PostgreSQL database;
  Develop endpoints for the necessary CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing users and books;
  Implement secure authentication using JWT (JSON Web Token) (OPTIONAL).</p>
  
  <h2><p>Delivery 3: Frontend Development and Backend Integration</p></h2>
  <p>In the final phase, teams will develop the user interface (frontend) and integrate the frontend with the backend:
  Implement the frontend using React.js;
  Create interactive pages and components for the functionalities of registration, book management, book search, and book exchange;
  Connect the frontend to the API developed in the previous phase, ensuring that all operations are executed correctly.</p>
</ul>
